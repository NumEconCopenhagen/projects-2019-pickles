# Welcome to our NumEconCPH repository

We have provided you with the following repository that contains the required structure for this course. **You should not change any folders in the root directory**.

A short description of the files and folders:

* [README.md](/README.md): gives a short introduction to our project.
* [/binder](/binder/): The folder is used by mybinder.org to setup an interactive version of our repository. For details see this [guide](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/mybinder/).
* [/dataproject](/dataproject): The structure is as follows: it contains a jupyter notebook where all the results should be presented. Furthermore, there is a python module named the dataproject where we can write and structure all our code.
* [/examproject](/examproject): Same structure as above.
* [/modelproject](/modelproject): Same structure as above.
* [.gitignore](/.gitignore): A textfile specifying files and folder that will not be uploaded to github, and will not be tracked by git.
