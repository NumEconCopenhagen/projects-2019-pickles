# Dataproject



see file "dataproject_final.ipynb" under "dataproject"

The following project concerns the study of demography and the composition of the population divided into age and gender. The underlying data for this project is based on past data and projections for the future.
Please note that genereally there is a statistic uncertainty regarding the projections,since they are based on assumptions made for future developments in fertility, mortality and migration. This is subject to uncertainty. The further out in the future, the greater the uncertainty is.
The data, which is being used in this project is fetched directly from the two data sets "FRDK118" and "FOLK2" from Danmarks Statistik, DST.

The data will be visualized in the form of an interactive population pyramid, showing the age and gender distribution throughout the years spanning from 1980 to 2060 for the total population of Denmark.
